# PySpark Real-time Sales Analysis 💼📊

## Overview 🚀

This PySpark project provides an end-to-end solution for real-time sales analysis. It aims to understand business requirements, process the dataset, and derive key performance indicators (KPIs) for business growth.

### Business Requirements 📋

- Clients provide data in CSV format, which needs cleaning and processing.
- Business aims to enhance growth by analyzing sales data and deriving insights.

### Dataset 📂

The dataset comprises two CSV files:

1. **Sales Data (`sales.csv.txt`)**:
    - Customer ID

2. **Product Data (`menu.csv.txt`)**:
    - Product ID
    - Product Name
    - Price

## Agenda 📅

1. **Understanding Business Requirements**:
    - Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
